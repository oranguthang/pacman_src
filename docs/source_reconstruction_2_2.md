# Source Reconstruction 2.2

Source Reconstruction 2.2 is a compatible-minor development line over the
published Source Reconstruction 2.1 tag. It modernizes the repository without
changing the canonical Japan V1.0 image or weakening any accepted 2.1
guarantee.

The published `source-reconstruction-2.1` tag and its manifest remain immutable.
The exact predecessor is commit
`1a825d3010bac2ac9c5cd8772e5352537016b526`; all 2.2 work occurs after that
commit on the `source-reconstruction-2.2` branch.

## Current status

The release status is `development`. The project manifest and canonical
source-layout registry are present, every official revision publishes explicit
input/layout/output/capability contracts, and the accepted 2.1 guarantees have
a reusable predecessor gate. The repository reorganization, clean-build
boundary, UI smoke coverage, and complete project release audit are not yet
complete. No 2.2 tag should be created until every planned requirement is
satisfied and the full pre-tag gate passes from a clean build on the supported
Windows host.

## Accepted baseline

Source 2.2 inherits and must continue to execute all Source 2.1 guarantees:

- byte-identical reconstruction of all seven official profiles;
- direct FCEUX title/runtime smoke coverage for every profile;
- semantic runtime, scoring, and reconstruction-evidence scenarios;
- isolated fixed-layout and NROM-256 authoring variants;
- live debugger-symbol validation;
- canonical symbolic-relocation regression;
- pinned ca65, ld65, FCEUX, artifact, licensing, and provenance contracts.

The development manifest is `config/source_reconstruction_2_2.json`. It is a
self-contained statement of the public project boundary and records only the
delta after Source 2.1.

## Planned repository delta

The remaining compatible work is organized as vertical, testable slices:

1. separate reusable functional gates from pre-tag and post-tag repository
   state checks, and require a clean build for the release path;
2. group Make, Python tools, and tests by responsibility or record a precise
   deviation with an equivalent control;
3. consolidate reproducible outputs under the build root and keep private
   authoring documents in one ignored workspace;
4. add a ROM-less scaffold gate, generated/tested command help, and workstation
   UI interaction smokes for the supported Studios;
5. validate history, delta, paths, profile coverage, artifacts, and tag state in
   the Source 2.2 release audit.

Cross-profile relocation, a sibling engine, and a new platform/container ABI
remain excluded. The existing NROM-256 architecture predates this minor line
and remains isolated by `docs/adr/0001-expanded-nrom256.md`.

## Gate names

During development, the fast contract is:

```text
make source-2-2-audit
```

The final interfaces will be:

```text
make source-2-2-check
make source-2-2-post-tag-audit
```

`source-2-2-check` must first execute the reusable accepted Source 2.1 baseline,
then the complete 2.2 delta, and finally the pre-tag audit. A green collection
of narrower tests does not replace that aggregate gate.
